# A blog system

Just a little blog system I'm working on in my spare time. This thing doesn't
have a name yet, but it's a flat-file blog system with a focus on performance and ease of use.

## 0.1.0 roadmap

- [ ] Admin views and logic

- [ ] Performance testing and comparisons to other systems
- [ ] Extract common code into packagist libraries with tests
